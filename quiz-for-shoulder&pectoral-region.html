    options: ["Supraspinatus", "Infraspinatus", "Teres minor", "Teres major"], 
    correct: "Teres major",
    explanation: "The rotator cuff consists of four muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. Teres major is not part of the rotator cuff; it's a different muscle that acts as an adductor and medial rotator of the arm."
  },
  { 
    question: "The chief abductor of the shoulder joint beyond 15° is:", 
    options: ["Supraspinatus", "Deltoid", "Trapezius", "Teres major"], 
    correct: "Deltoid",
    explanation: "While supraspinatus initiates the first 15° of abduction, the deltoid muscle is the primary abductor for abduction beyond 15° up to 90°."

  { 
    question: "The long thoracic nerve supplies:", 
    options: ["Pectoralis minor", "Serratus anterior", "Subclavius", "Trapezius"], 
    correct: "Serratus anterior",
    explanation: "The long thoracic nerve (C5-C7) supplies the serratus anterior muscle. Damage to this nerve causes winging of the scapula."

  },
  { 
    question: "The most common dislocation of the shoulder is:", 
    options: ["Posterior", "Anterior inferior", "Superior", "Medial"],
